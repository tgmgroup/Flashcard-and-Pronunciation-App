A tool for Japanese students to listen to, review, and test their knowledge of English words.

There are three modes to this tool. 
- Mode 1: Full Word List
- Mode 2: Flashcard Matching (of English and Japanese meanings)
- Mode 3: Speak & Check (Speak the correct English word for the Japanese flashcard)

This tool automatically loads a preseeded list and associated audio files (made with Microsoft's Ava voice and NaturalReaders.com).

If you fork this project, change the URL for this list (and the associated voice file URLs in that list) to your own file.
